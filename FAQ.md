* Decorations
* Some colours might not match properly. Let me know if you 
* Some bricks and pieces might not match correctly if the colour is available twice under different Element ID in the shop.


### Where are the prices coming from?
From the official The LEGO Group [Bricks and Pieces customer support website](https://wwwsecure.us.lego.com/en-us/service/replacementparts). Prices are based on the currency selected.


### What are you doing with LDD files once uploaded? 
The LDD files are analyzed and then destroyed.


### What is LDD?
LDD stands for [Lego Digital Designer](http://ldd.lego.com/)


### Why are multi-parts element are split when analysing LDD? 
LDD file separate the multi-parts in their base elements which numbers are different from the assembled element ID. I'm working on that ;) 


### Why are multicoloured parts are not automatically found ?
Matching those multicoloured parts to the Lego website is tricky because they don't use a straightforward color code. Working on that too.


### Why do I need to select a countries? 
The country selected dictate the store and currency the parts will be fetched from. Select the country you would normally buy from.


### Why is Canada the default country? 
Because I'm Canadian :P
